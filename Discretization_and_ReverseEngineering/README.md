# discretization_and_reverse_engineering

This is the data, source code, and reverse engineering machines utilized in Y. Li's 2016 Fall Rotation project with Dr. Paola Vera-Licona. 

CSR: 
computations based on Saez‐Rodriguez, Julio, et al. "Discrete logic modelling as a means to link protein signalling networks with functional analysis of mammalian signal transduction." Molecular systems biology 5.1 (2009): 331.
Referred as CSR network in our project. 

IRMA: 
computations based on Cantone, Irene, et al. "A yeast synthetic network for in vivo assessment of reverse-engineering and modeling approaches." Cell 137.1 (2009): 172-181.
Referred as IRMA network in our project. 

Pandapas: 
a in silico network to validate our two-step discretization evaluation (TEDIE) procedure. Network from Camacho, Diogo, et al. "Comparison of Reverse‐Engineering Methods Using an in Silico Network." Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences 1115.1 (2007): 73-89. Note that the data is newly generated. 
Both gold standard and original data are in this folder. 


YeastInSilico:
computations based on Li, Peng, et al. "Gene regulatory network inference and validation using relative change ratio analysis and time-delayed dynamic Bayesian network." EURASIP Journal on Bioinformatics and Systems Biology 2014.1 (2014): 1.
Data source is from DREAM 3 challenge, we refer this network as YeastInSilico network.

NOTE THAT ALL THE COMPUTATION FOLDERS THAT ARE TAGGED WITH A DATE ARE COMPUTATIONS DONE AFTERWARDS AND NOT IN THE PAPER!
ALL THE FILES ARE ORIGINAL COMPUTATION FILES, WHICH ARE MESSY!
LOOK FOR DESCRIPTION FILES (such as .docx file) THAT YOU ARE INTERESTED IN
