# Benchmarking Time-Series Data Discretization on Inference Methods

In this repository are all the datasets, source code and computations for the paper entitled "Benchmarking Time-Series Data Discretization on Inference Methods".


## Contents
- Folder "TEDIE" contains all benchmarking computations (MATLAB 2016a),
- Folder "pyTEDIE" has the Python source code of TEDIE, 
- older "Discretization_and_ReverseEngineering" for the relevant computations (discretization, reverse engineering, and TEDIE) in CSR, IRMA, Pandapas and YeastInSilico networks.
